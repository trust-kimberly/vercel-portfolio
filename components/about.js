      <p>Curious about programming as a creative medium, I began teaching myself to code through the generosity of freecodecamp.com, Codecademy, YouTube, and the community that is StackOverFlow. Freelancing as a web designer and developer, I found the process of designing my own wireframes to build and deploy as exciting as it was fulfilling.</p>
      <p>Currently based in Los Angeles, I am open to local and remote opportunities in web design, product design, and frontend development.</p>
